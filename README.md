# Evan's Dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles for my macOS devices. It includes a simple setup script that links files from the repository to the proper location on disk.

Note that running `setup.sh` is not sufficient to set up a new device. There are steps that cannot be included in the shell script, such as importing GPG2 keys.
